This lab showcases Modern Analytics with Microsoft Fabric and Azure Databricks, featuring a cost-effective, performance-optimized, and cloud-native Analytics solution pattern. This architecture unifies our customers' data estate to accelerate data value creation. The visual illustrates the real-world example for Contoso, a fictitious company. Contoso is a retailer with thousands of brick-and-mortar stores across the world. They also have an online store. Contoso is acquiring Litware Inc. Litware Inc. has curated marketing data and sales data processed by Azure Databricks and stored in the gold layer in ADLS Gen 2. In the following exercises, you will see how the Contoso team leveraged the power of Microsoft Fabric to ingest data from disparate sources, combine data with their existing data from ADLS Gen2, and derive meaningful insights. You will witness how the team used a shortcut to reference the existing Litware Inc. data from ADLS Gen2. Finally, you will see the advantages of Unity Catalog and creating LLM Chatbots with the Data Intelligence Platform.

The lab scenario starts on January 30th. The company's new CEO, April, recently noticed negative trends in their KPIs, including:

- High customer churn

- Declining sales revenue

- High bounce rate on their website

- High operating expense

- Poor customer experience

April asks Rupesh, the Chief Data Officer how they could create a data driven organization and reverse these adverse KPI trends. Rupesh talks to his technical team, including Eva, the data engineer, Miguel, the data scientist and Wendy, the business analyst. Rupesh tasks them with designing and implementing a solution pattern to realize this dream of a data driven organization. Our story centers around Rupesh and his team. They recognize that the existence of data silos within Contoso's various departments presents a significant integration challenge.

During this lab you will execute some of these steps as a part of this team to reverse these adverse KPI trends.
